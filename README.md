<b>API for: Binbox, Shorte, Relink, nCrypt, Imgur, Picload, encrypterme.ga, youpaste.co, linkcrypter.net, Deviansart</b></br></br>

<b>Introduction:</b></br></br>

Several images Host and monetization services have an API, which often tends to be hardly accessible from .Net. technology.</br>
These APIs have a common operation. Data are sent to the web via a POST request, and it returns a text (link) in JSON, XML, plain, etc.</br>
The composition of elements to post includes one or more identifiers (ID, hash), as well as data processing either text or a file.</br>
This composition may be truly single or complex as in the case of Binbox.</br>
Requests are almost always performed asynchronously via HttpWebRequest, but are implemented several simple examples using WebClient.</br></br>

This code is shown as a simple way to access from c#.<br></br>

<b>API's:</b></br></br>

<i>Monetization Services</i></br>

You need an account in each web service, and activate API (user options).</br></br>

<b>Points of interest:</b></br>

The integration between Java and .Net need an additional DLL, Jurassic.dll. Getting to understand how this integration work can be very complex, but once acquired the necessary knowledge, a range of possibilities for carrying out all kinds of scripts written in Java from .Net.</br>
The Binbox monetization service uses <a href="https://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/"><i>"Javascript Stanford Crypto Library"</i></a></br>
Thanks to this integration of both platforms (Java and .NET), in a couple of lines of code can solve problems that otherwise would require migration code, a task that can take months.</br></br>

To access Picload, it has created a DLL supports COM technology more than 20 years that still holds true in Windows environments. This makes it possible to call from PHP, Excel, Java, or any Windows application.</br></br>

The interface design is inspired by current Windows 10 and Android (Metro/Modern)</br></br>

An Input Box with same design, allows a simple way to interact with the user.</br></br>

The massive use of these APIs can block your user account, or even banned from the service.</br></br>

The code don't have error control (try/catch), no brackets, and no comments.</br></br>
